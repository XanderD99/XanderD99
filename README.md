# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @XanderD99

Iâ€™m a passionate software engineer based in Belgium, currently working as a full-stack developer at Be-Mobile. My day-to-day work primarily involves building solutions with Golang and Flutter, where I contribute to apps that enhance mobility and safety. One of the key projects Iâ€™ve been a part of is Sway, a safety app designed for cyclists and pedestrians, helping to make road safety smarter and more accessible.

While I work with backend-heavy technologies at Be-Mobile, in my free time, I love experimenting with JavaScript, Nuxt, and Strapi. Iâ€™ve developed two Strapi plugins that are performing quite well in the community, and I take pride in their impact. Additionally, I enjoy creating small Discord botsâ€”projects that combine my love for coding with my passion for gaming and community-building.

At the heart of my work is a love for problem-solving and the creative challenges of building user-friendly applications. Whether it's crafting efficient code for an app or developing fun and helpful packages for other developers, Iâ€™m always motivated by the desire to create enjoyable and effective experiences.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid gamer and enjoy riding my bicycle, which is a perfect way to recharge and stay connected to my passion for mobility.
